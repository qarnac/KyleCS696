				<h3>General Description</h3>
				<p>
					Designed for students beginning to learn grammar and elementary 
					arithmetic including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
					division as well as an additional category of prime numbers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The grammar portion of the game includes three categories 
					which include nouns, verbs, or adjectives. 
				</p>
				<p>
                    The math portion gives players the ability to choose from three difficulty 
                    levels which are easy, intermediate, and hard.  Game variables can also be 
                    altered which affect how the game is played such as player speed, the number 
                    of possible answers, and the presence of an enemy player.

				<h3>Game Details</h3>
				<p>
					For math based problems, the number range will vary for each problem 
					type depending upon the difficulty level chosen.  Subtraction will always result 
					in a non-negative value, and the quotient in a division problem will always be 
					a whole number.  The following list provides the problem type followed by 
					the number range for easy, intermediate, and hard difficulty:
					<ul>
						<li>Addition (0-6 + 0-6, 0-20 + 7-20, 0-30 + 21-30)</li>
						<li>Subtraction (0-8 - 0-8, 15-20 - 0-14, 21-35 - 0-20)</li>
						<li>Multiplication (0-5 x 0-5, 4-9 x 6-9, 5-12 x 9-12)</li>
						<li>Division (0-25 รท 1-25, 10-48 รท 2-24, 20-100 รท 2-50)</li>
						<li>Prime Numbers (2-23, 24-61, 62-103)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					For grammar based problems, a sentence will be provided with the ability to click
					on any of the available words.  The player will be asked to click on a number of either 
					nouns, verbs, or adjectives in the sentence before advancing to the next question.  Here are 
					some examples of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
				</p>	
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Nouns (car, baseball, afternoon)</li>
						<li>Verbs (run, behave, concentrate)</li>
						<li>Adjectives (red, boring, embarrased)</li>
					</ul>
